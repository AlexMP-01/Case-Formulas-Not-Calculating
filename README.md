# Excel-problem
A user reports that the formulas in their Excel spreadsheet are not calculating. Instead of showing the result of the formula, the cells display the formula itself (e.g., =SUM(A1:A10)). Device: Laptop (Windows 11) Excel Version: Microsoft Excel (latest version) Excel File: A financial report spreadsheet.

*There are several common mistakes users make in Excel that can lead to formulas not calculating properly. These include:

*Entering a formula as text (preceded by an apostrophe).

*Not using proper cell references, which can lead to errors or unexpected results.

*Forgetting to press Enter after entering a formula, which may leave the formula in edit mode.

*Using the wrong format for numbers, such as entering them with commas or currency symbols when not necessary.
