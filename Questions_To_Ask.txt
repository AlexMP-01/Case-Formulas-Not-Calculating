# Excel-problem
A user reports that the formulas in their Excel spreadsheet are not calculating. Instead of showing the result of the formula, the cells display the formula itself (e.g., =SUM(A1:A10)). Device: Laptop (Windows 11) Excel Version: Microsoft Excel (latest version) Excel File: A financial report spreadsheet.

Suggested Questions to Ask:

-Is Excel's calculation mode set to "Manual" or "Automatic"?

-Are there any text indicators in the formula cells (e.g., an apostrophe before the formula)?

-Has the file been shared with others, or is it stored on a network drive?

-Has the cell format for the formula cells been set to something other than "General" or "Number"?

-Have there been any recent Excel updates or changes to the computer's settings?

-Is the formula showing an error code (e.g., #NAME?, #VALUE!) or just the formula itself?

There are several common mistakes users make in Excel that can lead to formulas not calculating properly. These include:

*Entering a formula as text (preceded by an apostrophe).

*Not using proper cell references, which can lead to errors or unexpected results.

*Forgetting to press Enter after entering a formula, which may leave the formula in edit mode.

*Using the wrong format for numbers, such as entering them with commas or currency symbols when not necessary.
